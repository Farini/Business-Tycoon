## ‚ö†Ô∏è Construction

This project is open to Natural selection. If it succeeds, it will come out as an app in the app store, and the developers who contribute will be the owners of the project, and therefore own equity on the final product.
This project is put on a public repository until it gains enough momentum to move to a private repository.
During this "trial" period, while the repository is public, anyone is welcome to come in and contribute.
When the "trial" period ends, and the project is moved to a private repository, in case there are contributors other than myself, I will run a meeting to estabilish ownership and equity.

Stages:
- Github Public repo
- Github private + public repo
- TestFlight app
- AppStore app
